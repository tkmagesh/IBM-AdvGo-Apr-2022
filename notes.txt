About You:
    Name
    Primary Skillset
    Experience in Go
    Have you have attended my "Go basics" program?
        

Go
    Higher Order Functions
    Duck typing (implicitly implemented interfaces)
    Concurrency


Concurrency
    NEVER ASSUME the following
        1. the sequence of execution of your goroutines
        2. the time taken for a goroutine to complete its job

    Channels
        Receive operation is ALWAYS a blocking operation
        A Send operation is blocked until a receive operation on the channel is initiated (non-buffered Channel)
        In a buffered channel, the send operation will be successful even when a receive operation is not initiated
            coz, the data will be kept in the buffer

    Modify the demo-15.go in such way that  the "genEvenNos" will keep generating even numbers until the user hits the ENTER key
    NOTE : Do not accept user input in the genEvenNos() function

GRPC
    protocol buffers
    http2
    multi language support
    Communication Patterns
        Request & Response
        Client Streaming (multiple requests & one response)
        Server Streaming (one request & multiple responses)
        Bi-directional Streaming (multiple requests & multiple responses)
        
Process
    Define Schema (in protocol buffers)
        Service Contract
        Operation Contract
        Data Contract
    Generate code (protoc)
        Proxy (client)
        Stub (server)
    Implement the Service Contract
        Service Implementation
    Host the server

    Installation
        go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
        go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest

        (when the above is installed, executables are created in the gopath/bin folder. Make sure this path is set in environment variables)

        Windows
            Install the binaries from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/

        Mac
            brew install protoc-gen-go
            brew install protoc-gen-go-grpc

To generate the proxy and stub
    protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative proto/service.proto

Http Services
    - platform APIs
    - Libraries
        Routing

    - JWT middleware for Gin
        https://github.com/appleboy/gin-jwt

Web Socket
    HTML5 standard
    Supported in all the browsers
